# Mail Container
This project makes it easy to manage data or mail from forms on your website.

# How does it work
- Form data or mails from your website are written to the incomming_mail.txt file
- Copied to mail_storage.txt file at 13:00

# Remeber !
- Copy the entire code to your website's code file
- Data from your website should be written instead of 'Merhaba'
- You have to direct the data in the mail_storage.txt file to your email instead of the data from the forms on your site.
